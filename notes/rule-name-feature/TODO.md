# Rule Name Feature TODO

- [x] Rework `Rule` interface defaults to remove shared map and rely on per-instance storage.
- [x] Implement JSON-based default naming in `AbstractRule` with a real `name` field and reset semantics.
- [x] Update composite rules to generate structured JSON names from their child rule names.
- [x] Refresh unit tests and changelog to cover the JSON naming behaviour.
- [x] Run formatting plus the full Maven test suite before final review.
