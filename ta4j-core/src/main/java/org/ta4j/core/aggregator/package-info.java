/**
 * Aggregation utilities for transforming bars and bar series.

 * <p>Provides interfaces and implementations to convert a list of

 * into aggregated forms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.ta4j.core.aggregator.BarAggregator} - low-level list-to-list aggregation</li>
 * <li>{@link org.ta4j.core.aggregator.BarSeriesAggregator} - series-to-series aggregation</li>
 * <li>{@link org.ta4j.core.aggregator.DurationBarAggregator} - time-based upsampling (e.g., 1m â†’ 5m)</li>
 * <li>{@link org.ta4j.core.aggregator.HeikinAshiBarAggregator} - Heikin-Ashi transformation</li>
 * </ul>
